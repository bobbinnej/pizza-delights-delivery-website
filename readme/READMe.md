## Behaviour Driven Development


BDD focuses on how the user will navigate the pizza delights website alll the way till checkout.

As the creator i would like the user to:

1. Visit the pizza delights website.
2. The user will be met by a click to make an order  button.
3. Upon clicking, the user is directed to a page where they can get to navigate and see   
   various pizza sizes, crusts and topping so as to ease their selection process. 
4. Once the user has made up their mind, they then go ahead to click the "make your order 
   button".
5. The user will then be directed to the order details form that requires them to select:

- Number or pizza orders
- Size of pizza
- Type of pizza crust
- Desired toppings
- Delivery option

6. Upon checkout the user gets their total order summary
